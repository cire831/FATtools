Advantages of common_getattr & pack technique in respect of property():
- defer unpacking at effective access time
- unpack *once* only what needed
- pack *once* the full buffer

BUGS/TODO: (disk.py)
optimize SetFilePointer speed due to 64-bit upgrading?



BUGS/TODO: (FAT.py)
- check 255 chars limit in nested directories (investigate in exFAT too)
- raise/manage an exception if no more allocatable clusters? free partly allocated ones? or return them?
- date/time preservation in fat_copy_tree_extract (exFAT too)
- merge create in open with modes? (exFAT too)
- stat in dirtable? (exFAT too)
- open w/ full path like opendir? (exFAT too)
- must invalidate handle to erased/replaced objects not explicitly closed!
- unique handle to directories (to auto-update on closing)?
- pack & co.: update str += str with list join
- 65,534 bytes limit for a folder?
- use FAT32 FSInfo
- parameters {} to tune cluster allocator?
- guard against seek beyond last valid offset (specially in FixedRoot)
- generalize pack() in utils.py



BUGS/TODO: (exFAT.py)
- implement frags, clean & co.
- mkdirs?
- merge exFAT w/ FAT Chain (write) // 31.8.16 bug in FAT alloc prevented this?
- implement set/clear Label (FAT too)
BITMAP:
- Bitmap findfree alternative?
- findfree with tuple (start, run) for free clusters account?
- set ranges of bits/fat slots at once!
- read bitmap 128 bit at once and use math to find set/clear bits?
- write set bit runs multiple bytes at once?
- bitmap is FATted, so it's slower: dict{pos:QWORD}?
- defer Bitmap file update (allocation is really showed already by slot or FAT)?
OTHER:
- test 256M limit per directory table?
- fix setting last allocated cluster (is lower than reqd?)
- parameters {} to tune cluster allocator?
- generalize pack() in utils.py



BUGS/TODO: (Reorder.pyw)
exclude . and .. from subdirs
use U D T button and eventually other accelerators?
double-click/enter on dir item scans it
